function b = sig2bw(w, s)% SIG2BW% sig2bw returns the octave bandwidth of a gabor function given a frequency% and space constant.% usage: b = sig2bw(w, s) where%				w is frequency in cycles/unit%				s is standard deviation in unit% the unit (deg, cm, pixels, seconds, etc.) must be the same in both arguments.% the bandwidth, b, is the full width at half-height (in octaves) of the % gabor's fourier spectruma = sqrt(log(2)/2)/(pi * s);u = w + a;l = w - a; b = log(u/l)/log(2);
