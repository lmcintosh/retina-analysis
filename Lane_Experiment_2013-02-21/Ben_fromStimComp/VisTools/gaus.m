function A = gaus(n, s)% GAUSSIAN  makes a 1D gaussian vector.% % usage:%	GAUSSIAN(N, S) makes a vector of length N containing a gaussian% 	with std. deviation s and unit area.%	GAUSSIAN(X, S), where X is a vector, computes the gaussian over%	the domain of X%     % see also: dog, gab, ddog, ggab, ggaus% % Lawrence K.
