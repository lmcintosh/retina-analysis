function s=spike3d(alpha, r, c, p)% SPIKE3D - makes a volume in which the value is proportional to the%           distance from the origin (to the alpha power).%% usage:%     S = SPIKE3D(ALPHA, R, C, P) produces an RxCxP array, the value%                           of which falls off as 1/(d^ALPHA) where d is%                           the euclidean distance from the array center.%     %     Useful for making 1/f^alpha noise movies.%     % See also:  spike(), oneoverf(), oneoverf3d()% % Lawrence K.
